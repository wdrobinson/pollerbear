<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p> We take your privacy very seriously. You'll find our privacy policy below.</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our website.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. PollerBear uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of our website, and their website access preferences. PollerBear visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using PollerBear’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of PollerBear’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by PollerBear and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, PollerBear may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in PollerBear’s sole discretion. PollerBear encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.</p>
